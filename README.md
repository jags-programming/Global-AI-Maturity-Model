# 🌐 Global AI Maturity Model (GAIMM)

**GAIMM** is an open-source, community-driven framework designed to assess, guide, and accelerate AI maturity across organizations. It provides a structured, flexible model for evaluating progress across six key pillars — enabling data-driven decisions, strategic alignment, and responsible scaling of AI capabilities.

---

## 🚀 Vision

To empower organizations globally — across public, private, and non-profit sectors — with an adaptable, inclusive framework to evaluate and advance their AI maturity in a transparent, ethical, and collaborative way.

---

## 📊 Why GAIMM?

Most organizations today are either overwhelmed by AI hype or struggle to measure actual progress. GAIMM fills this gap by offering:

- ✅ A **holistic, pillar-based maturity model**
- ✅ Clearly defined **levels of maturity (L1 to L5)** for each pillar
- ✅ Tools and templates for **self-assessment and benchmarking**
- ✅ A **collaborative platform** for evolving the model with the community
- ✅ Focus on **ethics, governance, and sustainable growth** alongside tech

## 🧱 Pillars of AI Maturity

GAIMM organizes AI maturity across six foundational dimensions:

![GAIMM Model Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jags-programming/Global-AI-Maturity-Model/main/diagrams/GAIMM%20model%20diagram.png)

1. **Strategy & Governance** – Vision, leadership buy-in, AI policy, strategic alignment
2. **Organization & Talent** – AI roles, upskilling, organizational structure, CoE
3. **Data & Infrastructure** – Data quality, accessibility, tools, compute, APIs, cloud
4. **AI Lifecycle & Operations** – Model development, validation, deployment, MLOps, monitoring
5. **Ethics, Risk & Compliance** – Fairness, transparency, safety, regulatory readiness
6. **Impact & Value Realization** – Use case prioritization, KPI definition, ROI, scalability

Each pillar has **5 levels**:

| Level  | Label                     | Description                                                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **L1** | **Exploratory**           | Ad-hoc experimentation; isolated pilots, no AI governance or structure.             |
| **L2** | **Foundational**          | Initial strategy, emerging roles, basic use cases and compliance practices.         |
| **L3** | **Structured**            | Centralized governance, defined processes, early scaling, risk and ethics in place. |
| **L4** | **Enterprise-Integrated** | AI embedded across functions; measurable impact; aligned with business KPIs.        |
| **L5** | **Transformative**        | AI drives innovation and competitiveness; adaptive, learning org; continuous value. |
