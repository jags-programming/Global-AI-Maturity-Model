# 🌐 Global AI Maturity Model (GAIMM)

**GAIMM** is an open-source, community-driven framework designed to assess, guide, and accelerate AI maturity across organizations. It provides a structured, flexible model for evaluating progress across six key pillars — enabling data-driven decisions, strategic alignment, and responsible scaling of AI capabilities.

## 🚀 Vision

To empower organizations globally — across public, private, and non-profit sectors — with an adaptable, inclusive framework to evaluate and advance their AI maturity in a transparent, ethical, and collaborative way.

---

## 📊 Why GAIMM?

Most organizations today are either overwhelmed by AI hype or struggle to measure actual progress. GAIMM fills this gap by offering:

- ✅ A **holistic, pillar-based maturity model**
- ✅ Clearly defined **levels of maturity (L1 to L5)** for each pillar
- ✅ Tools and templates for **self-assessment and benchmarking**
- ✅ A **collaborative platform** for evolving the model with the community
- ✅ Focus on **ethics, governance, and sustainable growth** alongside tech

## 🧱 Pillars of AI Maturity

GAIMM organizes AI maturity across six foundational dimensions:

1. **Strategy** – Vision, leadership alignment, business value creation
2. **Governance** – Risk management, compliance, accountability structures
3. **Data** – Data quality, accessibility, management, and readiness
4. **Technology** – Infrastructure, AI lifecycle tools, model ops
5. **Talent & Culture** – Skills, mindset, collaboration, change management
6. **Ethics & Responsibility** – Bias mitigation, transparency, fairness

Each pillar has **5 levels**:
- L1 – Initial
- L2 – Emerging
- L3 – Established
- L4 – Integrated
- L5 – Optimized
