# Evaluation Criteria – Ethics, Risk & Compliance (GAIMM)

This document defines the evaluation criteria for the **Ethics, Risk & Compliance** pillar of the GAIMM framework. Each level includes five progressively advanced criteria to assess the maturity of an organization in this dimension.

## Pillar: Ethics, Risk & Compliance

Covers fairness, transparency, safety, and regulatory readiness of AI practices, ensuring trustworthiness and responsible deployment.

---

### Level 1: Exploratory

Ad-hoc experimentation; isolated pilots, no AI governance or structure.

1. **Ethical Awareness** – Limited or no awareness of ethical implications in AI usage.
2. **Risk Identification** – No structured process for identifying risks in AI initiatives.
3. **Compliance Consideration** – Regulatory requirements are unknown or not considered.
4. **Data Privacy Practices** – Inconsistent or absent privacy protections in AI projects.
5. **Bias Management** – No attention to detecting or mitigating algorithmic bias.

---

### Level 2: Foundational

Initial strategy, emerging roles, basic use cases and compliance practices.

1. **Ethical Guidelines** – Initial awareness and informal discussion of AI ethics.
2. **Basic Risk Review** – Emerging risk identification practices for select projects.
3. **Compliance Mapping** – Basic mapping to applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, local laws).
4. **Data Anonymization** – Some manual efforts for anonymization or pseudonymization.
5. **Bias Detection Tools** – Exploratory use of fairness/bias checking tools during development.

---

### Level 3: Structured

Centralized governance, defined processes, early scaling, risk and ethics in place.

1. **Ethics Committee** – Cross-functional team reviews AI projects for ethical concerns.
2. **Formal Risk Management** – Risk assessment frameworks applied across AI projects.
3. **Standard Compliance Checks** – Compliance reviews and documentation are built into development workflows.
4. **Data Governance Policies** – Formalized privacy and access control policies are applied consistently.
5. **Bias Audits** – Regular audits of models for bias, with mitigation plans and reporting.

---

### Level 4: Enterprise-Integrated

AI embedded across functions; measurable impact; aligned with business KPIs.

1. **Embedded Ethical Review** – Ethics assessments embedded in AI lifecycle checkpoints.
2. **Integrated Risk Scoring** – Risk scoring integrated with model approval and deployment.
3. **Regulatory Readiness** – Organization ready for external audits and regulatory scrutiny.
4. **Privacy by Design** – Systematic application of privacy principles in AI solution design.
5. **Fairness Benchmarks** – Organization-level KPIs for fairness, bias, and model transparency.

---

### Level 5: Transformative

AI drives innovation and competitiveness; adaptive, learning org; continuous value.

1. **Ethics-Driven Innovation** – Ethics used as a design principle to drive AI innovation.
2. **Continuous Risk Monitoring** – Real-time AI risk dashboards and scenario planning.
3. **Proactive Compliance** – Systems anticipate and adapt to evolving regulations globally.
4. **Ethical AI Culture** – Organization-wide culture supports responsible AI through training and incentives.
5. **Transparent AI Systems** – Full explainability, traceability, and auditability across AI systems.
