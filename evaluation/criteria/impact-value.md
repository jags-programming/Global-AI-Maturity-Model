# Evaluation Criteria – Impact & Value Realization (GAIMM)

This document outlines the evaluation criteria for the **Impact & Value Realization** pillar in the GAIMM framework. This pillar focuses on how organizations extract, measure, and scale value from AI initiatives.

## Pillar: Impact & Value Realization

Focuses on use case prioritization, KPI definition, ROI tracking, and scalability of AI initiatives across the organization.

---

### Level 1: Exploratory

Ad-hoc experimentation; isolated pilots, no AI governance or structure.

1. **Use Case Identification** – AI use cases are selected based on individual interest or convenience, with no business alignment.
2. **Value Metrics** – No formal KPIs are defined; impact is anecdotal or assumed.
3. **ROI Tracking** – Return on AI investments is not tracked or quantified.
4. **Scalability** – Models or solutions are not reused or scaled across teams or functions.
5. **Stakeholder Buy-in** – Business engagement is minimal or nonexistent.

---

### Level 2: Foundational

Initial strategy, emerging roles, basic use cases and compliance practices.

1. **Use Case Pipeline** – Early efforts to identify use cases with potential business value.
2. **Basic KPIs** – Some KPIs (e.g., efficiency gain, accuracy improvement) defined for selected projects.
3. **Initial ROI Estimation** – High-level ROI estimates or cost-benefit analyses are performed post-project.
4. **Reuse Awareness** – Teams begin to explore reusability or standardization opportunities.
5. **Stakeholder Engagement** – Some business functions start collaborating with technical teams.

---

### Level 3: Structured

Centralized governance, defined processes, early scaling, risk and ethics in place.

1. **Strategic Use Case Portfolio** – AI projects are prioritized based on business impact and feasibility assessments.
2. **Defined KPIs** – Clear KPIs aligned with business goals are defined and measured consistently.
3. **ROI Realization** – Frameworks in place for measuring financial and operational ROI.
4. **Solution Scaling** – Reusable components and models are actively promoted and reused.
5. **Cross-Functional Value Teams** – Cross-functional teams drive alignment between AI capabilities and business needs.

---

### Level 4: Enterprise-Integrated

AI embedded across functions; measurable impact; aligned with business KPIs.

1. **AI Roadmaps** – Use cases are part of long-term AI investment roadmaps and reviewed periodically.
2. **Enterprise KPI Dashboard** – Centralized, real-time tracking of AI-related KPIs across business units.
3. **Integrated ROI Management** – ROI tracking is integrated into project governance and funding decisions.
4. **Scaling Playbooks** – Playbooks and templates exist for replicating AI use cases across domains.
5. **Embedded AI Value Culture** – Business units embrace AI as a value-generating tool in their strategic planning.

---

### Level 5: Transformative

AI drives innovation and competitiveness; adaptive, learning org; continuous value.

1. **AI as Innovation Engine** – AI continuously fuels new business models, revenue streams, or market differentiation.
2. **Real-Time Business Impact** – AI contributions to KPIs are monitored and optimized in real time.
3. **Continuous Value Assessment** – Value realization is reviewed continuously and feeds back into AI strategy.
4. **Enterprise-Scale Reusability** – Reuse and composability are engineered into platforms, tools, and practices.
5. **AI-Driven Transformation Culture** – AI is core to organizational DNA, with executive accountability for value realization.
