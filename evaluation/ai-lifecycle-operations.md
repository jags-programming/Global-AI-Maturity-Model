# Evaluation Criteria – AI Lifecycle & Operations (GAIMM)

This document defines the evaluation criteria for the **AI Lifecycle & Operations** pillar of the GAIMM framework. Each level includes five progressively advanced criteria to assess the maturity of an organization in this dimension.

## Pillar: AI Lifecycle & Operations

Covers model development, validation, deployment, MLOps, and monitoring processes critical for operationalizing AI at scale.

---

### Level 1: Exploratory

Ad-hoc experimentation; isolated pilots, no AI governance or structure.

1. **Model Development** – Model building is informal and performed manually by individuals with minimal documentation.
2. **Validation & Testing** – No standardized approach to validate or test models; evaluation is ad-hoc.
3. **Deployment Process** – Models are deployed manually, if at all, without CI/CD or versioning.
4. **Monitoring** – No model performance or drift monitoring post-deployment.
5. **Tool Usage** – Individual choice of frameworks and tools with no shared lifecycle standards.

---

### Level 2: Foundational

Initial strategy, emerging roles, basic use cases and compliance practices.

1. **Basic Lifecycle Processes** – Initial templates or workflows exist for experimentation and model training.
2. **Validation Metrics** – Basic model metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision) are used; validation is semi-structured.
3. **Initial Deployment Capabilities** – Some models are deployed using scripts or manually configured APIs.
4. **Error Logging** – Basic logging of inference errors or system-level issues.
5. **Toolkits Adoption** – Teams begin aligning around common toolkits or libraries.

---

### Level 3: Structured

Centralized governance, defined processes, early scaling, risk and ethics in place.

1. **Model Lifecycle Governance** – Defined stages and approvals for development, validation, and release.
2. **Testing Frameworks** – Standardized unit, integration, and regression testing of models.
3. **Deployment Pipelines** – CI/CD for ML models begins, with version control and rollback capabilities.
4. **Performance Monitoring** – Regular tracking of model performance and retraining triggers.
5. **Model Registry** – Use of model registries for model lineage and reproducibility.

---

### Level 4: Enterprise-Integrated

AI embedded across functions; measurable impact; aligned with business KPIs.

1. **Automated Pipelines** – Integrated pipelines from data prep to deployment using orchestration tools.
2. **Continuous Validation** – Automated retraining and testing integrated into lifecycle workflows.
3. **Enterprise CI/CD** – Scalable deployment pipelines aligned with enterprise DevOps standards.
4. **Monitoring & Alerts** – Real-time monitoring with alerts for performance degradation or concept drift.
5. **Collaborative Platforms** – Teams collaborate via shared platforms for development, documentation, and feedback.

---

### Level 5: Transformative

AI drives innovation and competitiveness; adaptive, learning org; continuous value.

1. **Self-Healing Pipelines** – AI systems auto-detect and respond to drift, failures, or performance drops.
2. **Automated Governance** – Policy enforcement and audit trails embedded into lifecycle tooling.
3. **Real-Time Deployment** – Models can be deployed or updated in real time with zero downtime.
4. **Closed-Loop Learning** – Systems learn from outcomes, user interactions, and feedback continuously.
5. **Unified MLOps Platform** – Fully integrated, enterprise-grade MLOps supporting rapid experimentation and business agility.
