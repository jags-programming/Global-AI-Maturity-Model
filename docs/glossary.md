# GAIMM Glossary

This glossary defines key terms and concepts used throughout the Global AI Maturity Model (GAIMM). It serves as a shared vocabulary to ensure clarity, alignment, and common understanding across stakeholders.

---

## A

### AI Governance  
A structured framework of policies, roles, responsibilities, and controls designed to ensure ethical, transparent, and accountable use of AI technologies within an organization.

### AI Maturity  
The degree to which an organization has institutionalized practices, capabilities, and governance mechanisms for the safe, effective, and responsible use of AI.

---

## B

### Bias Mitigation  
Processes and techniques used to detect, reduce, or eliminate unfair discrimination in data, models, or AI system behavior. Includes both pre-processing (data), in-processing (model), and post-processing (output) interventions.

---

## D

### Data Provenance  
The lineage or history of a dataset, including where it came from, how it has been transformed, and who has accessed or modified it. Essential for trust and reproducibility.

### Differential Privacy  
A mathematical technique to protect individual privacy in datasets by adding statistical noise, allowing patterns to be analyzed without exposing personal data.

---

## E

### Explainability  
The degree to which an AI system’s internal mechanics or outputs can be understood by humans. Often aligned with tools and techniques such as SHAP, LIME, or counterfactuals.

---

## F

### Fairness  
The principle that AI systems should operate impartially and equitably across different demographic or social groups, avoiding systemic bias or discrimination.

---

## G

### Governance Artifact  
Any document, checklist, policy, or audit trail that demonstrates compliance with AI governance processes (e.g., model risk assessments, data documentation, approval logs).

---

## M

### Model Lifecycle  
The end-to-end phases in an AI model’s journey—from data collection and training to deployment, monitoring, and retirement. Often mapped to ModelOps or MLOps processes.

### ModelOps  
An operational discipline that manages the lifecycle, monitoring, governance, and retraining of AI/ML models in production, ensuring that models remain reliable, relevant, and compliant.

---

## P

### Pillar  
One of the six foundational dimensions in GAIMM that define AI maturity. Each pillar reflects a core capability area (e.g., Data & Documentation, Risk & Compliance).

---

## R

### Responsible AI  
An umbrella concept referring to the development and deployment of AI systems that align with ethical values, legal standards, and social expectations.

---

## S

### Shadow AI  
AI models or tools developed and used within an organization without formal oversight, governance, or integration into central processes—often posing risks to compliance and security.

---

## T

### Transparency  
The degree to which an AI system’s data sources, decision logic, performance, and limitations are made visible and understandable to relevant stakeholders.

---

## U

### Use Case Inventory  
A structured listing of all AI use cases deployed or in development within an organization, typically including metadata like objectives, data sources, risk tier, and owner.

---

## V

### Value Realization  
A measure of whether an AI initiative delivers its intended business, operational, or social impact, considering both short-term gains and long-term sustainability.
