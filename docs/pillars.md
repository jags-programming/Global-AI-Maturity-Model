# 🧱 The Six Pillars of GAIMM

The Global AI Maturity Model (GAIMM) is built around **six foundational pillars** that collectively determine an organization’s readiness and capability to succeed with AI. Each pillar is essential — maturity in one without the others leads to imbalance, risk, and limited value.

This document defines each pillar, explains its significance, and outlines key indicators of maturity across real-world contexts.

---

## 1. Strategy & Vision

### 📌 Definition
A clear, organization-wide understanding of why AI matters and how it aligns with long-term goals, values, and priorities.

### 💡 Why It Matters
Without a shared vision, AI investments become fragmented or misaligned. Strategic clarity enables prioritization, funding, and cross-functional engagement.

### ✅ Real-World Indicators
- AI goals are embedded in business strategy
- Leadership champions AI adoption
- Dedicated budget and investment roadmap
- Clear articulation of AI’s value to stakeholders

---

## 2. Governance, Ethics & Risk

### 📌 Definition
Frameworks and practices to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly, legally, and ethically.

### 💡 Why It Matters
AI decisions can impact people’s lives, create unintended bias, or introduce compliance risks. Governance enables trust and long-term sustainability.

### ✅ Real-World Indicators
- Ethical guidelines or responsible AI policy in place
- Data protection, fairness, and transparency practices
- AI-specific audit mechanisms
- Alignment with legal frameworks (e.g. GDPR, national laws)

---

## 3. People, Skills & Culture

### 📌 Definition
The organizational culture, talent, and training mechanisms that enable teams to effectively collaborate, build, and use AI systems.

### 💡 Why It Matters
AI adoption isn’t just technical — it requires a workforce that understands AI’s role, impact, and limitations.

### ✅ Real-World Indicators
- Training programs for both technical and non-technical staff
- Roles like data stewards, ML engineers, or AI ethicists exist
- Collaborative culture between domain experts and data teams
- Incentives for innovation and ethical decision-making

---

## 4. Data & Infrastructure

### 📌 Definition
The quality, availability, security, and governance of data and the supporting infrastructure that powers AI systems.

### 💡 Why It Matters
AI depends on data. Poor data quality, silos, or legacy infrastructure hinder progress and increase risks.

### ✅ Real-World Indicators
- Data catalogues and governance frameworks
- Secure data pipelines with lineage tracking
- Cloud and on-prem compute scaled for AI workloads
- Reuse of shared data assets across projects

---

## 5. Technology & Tools

### 📌 Definition
The technical capability to design, build, test, deploy, and monitor AI solutions — from simple models to large-scale applications.

### 💡 Why It Matters
Even with data and talent, lacking the right tools and engineering maturity can bottleneck AI initiatives.

### ✅ Real-World Indicators
- Standardized ML development environments
- Reusable components and pipelines
- Model deployment and monitoring systems
- Practices like CI/CD and MLOps in place

---

## 6. Adoption & Impact

### 📌 Definition
The degree to which AI is integrated into decision-making, service delivery, or business processes — and the outcomes it achieves.

### 💡 Why It Matters
The real value of AI lies in outcomes. Measuring adoption and impact closes the feedback loop and informs continuous improvement.

### ✅ Real-World Indicators
- AI integrated into day-to-day workflows or citizen services
- Change management and user onboarding strategies
- Clear KPIs and success metrics for AI
- Documented examples of impact or cost savings

---

## 📊 Interdependencies

These pillars are **interdependent**. For instance:

- Strong technology without governance leads to risk.
- Clear strategy without talent leads to execution gaps.
- Good data without impact measurement leads to wasted potential.

GAIMM encourages holistic maturity growth across **all six** areas.

## 🧭 Next Step: Maturity Levels

Each pillar is assessed across five levels of maturity (L1 to L5). These levels help organizations map their current state and plan a realistic path forward.

➡️ See: [`docs/maturity-model.md`](./maturity-model.md) for detailed maturity descriptors.
