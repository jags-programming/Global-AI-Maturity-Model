# üåê GAIMM Maturity Levels

The **Global AI Maturity Model (GAIMM)** defines **five progressive maturity levels** that describe an organization‚Äôs journey from isolated experimentation to enterprise-wide transformation through AI. These levels apply to **each of the six pillars** of AI maturity.

---

## üü§ Level 1: Exploratory

> _Ad-hoc experimentation; isolated pilots, no AI governance or structure._

**Description**  
Organizations are in the earliest phase of AI maturity. Initiatives are opportunistic, conducted by individual teams without coordination, standards, or long-term planning.

**Indicators**  
- Disconnected AI initiatives driven by local needs  
- No formal strategy or AI leadership  
- Lack of standardized tools, processes, or governance  
- No risk, ethics, or compliance considerations  
- Success depends on isolated champions or innovation units  

---

## üü† Level 2: Foundational

> _Initial strategy, emerging roles, basic use cases and compliance practices._

**Description**  
Organizations begin to build basic structures for AI. Strategy and leadership interest emerge, and early roles and responsibilities are defined. Governance and compliance start taking shape.

**Indicators**  
- AI is included in strategic discussions  
- Initial governance conversations and frameworks  
- Emerging roles such as data scientists and ML engineers  
- Data management and compliance practices are introduced  
- Limited but repeatable pilot projects  

---

## üü° Level 3: Structured

> _Centralized governance, defined processes, early scaling, risk and ethics in place._

**Description**  
AI capabilities are centralized, standardized, and supported by consistent processes. Organizations invest in formal governance, risk management, and early scaling.

**Indicators**  
- Centralized AI governance body or steering committee  
- MLOps practices adopted (CI/CD, monitoring, retraining)  
- Cross-functional collaboration between tech and business  
- Ethical guidelines defined and integrated  
- AI systems deployed and maintained in production  

---

## üü¢ Level 4: Enterprise-Integrated

> _AI embedded across functions; measurable impact; aligned with business KPIs._

**Description**  
AI becomes a strategic enabler across the enterprise. Capabilities are well-managed, measurable, and aligned with broader business goals. Risk and ethics are integrated into delivery.

**Indicators**  
- AI included in enterprise KPIs and performance reviews  
- Responsible AI principles operationalized  
- AI Centers of Excellence (CoEs) established  
- Cross-functional delivery teams at scale  
- Feedback loops from business outcomes influence AI roadmaps  

---

## üîµ Level 5: Transformative

> _AI drives innovation and competitiveness; adaptive, learning org; continuous value._

**Description**  
AI is embedded into the organization's DNA. It drives continuous innovation and business transformation. The organization is adaptive, ethical, and forward-looking.

**Indicators**  
- AI is a driver of competitive advantage  
- Continuous improvement of models and pipelines  
- Organization contributes to AI thought leadership and standards  
- Strong external partnerships and open innovation  
- AI innovation funding is sustained and forward-looking

## üìä How to Use These Levels

Each of the six GAIMM pillars (such as Talent, Data, Ethics, etc.) can be assessed **individually** using these levels. This helps organizations create a **maturity heatmap** to guide transformation, identify gaps, and benchmark progress across domains.
