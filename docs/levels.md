# GAIMM Maturity Levels

The Global AI Maturity Model (GAIMM) defines **five maturity levels** to help organizations assess and improve their AI capabilities in a structured and progressive manner. These levels apply consistently across each of the six pillars.

---

## Level 1: Initiated

**Description**  
AI activities are ad-hoc, isolated, and primarily exploratory. There is limited awareness of risks or opportunities, and no cohesive strategy.

**Indicators**  
- AI use is opportunistic and project-based  
- No centralized AI governance or guidelines  
- Limited awareness of ethical and regulatory considerations  
- Minimal documentation or knowledge sharing  
- Success depends on individual champions

---

## Level 2: Experimented

**Description**  
Initial experiments are conducted with some repeatable patterns. Early lessons are being learned, and teams start identifying AI-specific needs.

**Indicators**  
- Pilot projects exist with documented outcomes  
- Teams begin to recognize data quality and bias issues  
- Use of open-source or off-the-shelf models increases  
- Early conversations on governance, risk, and ethics  
- Isolated pockets of talent and reusable assets

---

## Level 3: Operationalized

**Description**  
AI capabilities are integrated into business processes. Teams develop repeatable deployment, monitoring, and governance practices.

**Indicators**  
- AI/ML systems deployed in production with support  
- MLOps practices adopted (CI/CD, monitoring, retraining)  
- Clear ownership of AI systems  
- AI included in risk management and compliance reviews  
- Cross-functional collaboration is established

---

## Level 4: Managed

**Description**  
AI is recognized as a strategic capability. There is standardization, proactive risk mitigation, and alignment with organizational goals.

**Indicators**  
- Enterprise-wide AI governance framework implemented  
- KPIs defined for measuring AI performance and impact  
- Responsible AI principles operationalized  
- Talent and tools consolidated into AI centers of excellence  
- Feedback loops inform continuous improvement

---

## Level 5: Optimized

**Description**  
AI is deeply embedded in culture, decision-making, and innovation. Capabilities are continuously improved, with lessons shared across the ecosystem.

**Indicators**  
- AI drives measurable business transformation  
- AI innovation is incentivized and continuously funded  
- Models learn and adapt in near-real-time  
- Organization contributes to AI standards and thought leadership  
- Strong external collaborations and open-source contributions

## How to Use These Levels

Each pillar of GAIMM (e.g., Data Readiness, Ethics, Talent, etc.) can be evaluated independently across these five levels. This enables a **multi-dimensional view** of an organizationâ€™s AI maturity, supporting both benchmarking and targeted improvement planning.
