# üåê Overview: Global AI Maturity Model (GAIMM)

## Purpose

The **Global AI Maturity Model (GAIMM)** is a public, open-source framework built to help organizations understand, evaluate, and accelerate their AI transformation journey. It is designed to be:

- **Actionable** ‚Äì providing structured tools and checklists for real-world assessments
- **Adaptable** ‚Äì usable across industries, regions, and sizes of organizations
- **Inclusive** ‚Äì shaped by global voices, promoting equity and responsible innovation

GAIMM enables organizations to identify where they stand today in their AI maturity, what good looks like, and how to evolve strategically toward AI excellence ‚Äî without losing sight of **governance**, **ethics**, and **people**.

## Philosophy

In a world increasingly shaped by AI, **maturity is more than model deployment**. It‚Äôs about organizational alignment, sustainable practices, and responsible scaling.

GAIMM rests on the belief that:

- **Maturity is multidimensional**: AI success isn't only technical. Strategy, culture, ethics, and data quality all matter.
- **Progress is contextual**: There is no one-size-fits-all pathway. GAIMM is flexible enough to accommodate regional, sectoral, and organizational differences.
- **Community is strength**: The best frameworks evolve collaboratively. GAIMM invites contributions from technologists, policy makers, academics, and business leaders alike.

We are committed to **transparency, continual refinement, and open governance** of this model.

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Six foundational pillars**, each with 5 levels of maturity (L1 to L5)
- ‚úÖ Practical tools and templates for self-assessment
- ‚úÖ Model-agnostic: applicable whether you‚Äôre using traditional ML, LLMs, or rule-based systems
- ‚úÖ Aligned with ethical, legal, and sustainability considerations
- ‚úÖ Community-governed and versioned

## Why Organizations Need This

AI holds enormous promise ‚Äî but also brings complexity. Most organizations struggle with:

- Lack of clarity on where they stand
- Gaps between technical ambition and strategic readiness
- Inconsistent governance practices
- Overreliance on tools without organizational change

GAIMM provides a **shared language and structure** to address these issues. It helps teams align their investments and activities around maturity-building efforts, not just tactical deployments.

## Who Should Use GAIMM

GAIMM is for:

- **Public Sector leaders** planning national AI strategies
- **Private Enterprises** aiming for competitive advantage through AI
- **NGOs and non-profits** applying AI in humanitarian contexts
- **Startups** building governance and ethical practices from day one
- **Academia** looking to incorporate real-world readiness models
- **Auditors, funders, and regulators** evaluating AI readiness and risk

## How GAIMM Is Different

| GAIMM Offers | Many Existing Models Lack |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Multi-pillar view | Tech-only focus |
| Ethics as a first-class pillar | Ethics as an afterthought |
| Open-source and community-driven | Proprietary or locked frameworks |
| Industry-agnostic and globally oriented | Region-specific models |
| Tools for self-assessment and roadmap | Descriptive but not actionable |

## Join the Movement

GAIMM is still evolving. Your ideas, use cases, localizations, and critiques will help shape the model to meet the world‚Äôs real AI transformation challenges.
